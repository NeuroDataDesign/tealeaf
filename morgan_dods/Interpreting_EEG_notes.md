## Epilepsy.com: How to Read an EEG

* Electrodes are placed in specific areas, according to internationally agreed-upon criteria and based on distance from four easily identifiable locations on the head
    * Occassionally, extra electrodes are placed in low signal areas
    * Sometimes heartbeat is also recorded (EKG)

* Electrode site names are based on lobe or area of the brain the electrode records from:
    * F(frontal), Fp(frontopolar), T(temporalm) C(central), P(parietal), O(occipital), A(auricular)
    * Numbers indicate location (odd = Left, even = Right, z = Middle)

* Uses amplifiers and analyzes information from different combinations (montages) of electrodes.
* To find where normal or abnormal brain waves are coming from, "phase reversal" must be identified. Phase reversal is a deflection of the two channels within a chain pointing to opposite directions.
