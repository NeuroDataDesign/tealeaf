    "I took the random forest implementation from the link above, and converted the data format from lists of lists to pandas DataFrames and Series to further understand how the random forest algorithm works. There is a bug in my current implementation that causes all accuracy scores to be 0, but I still feel I accomplished the object of this exercise: to deepen my understanding of coding a RF algorithm so I can follow the SPORF code and begin writing MORF in cython."
