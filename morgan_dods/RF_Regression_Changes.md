* Must evaluate forest with mean squared error instead of accuracy
* Select best split based off RSS instead of gini
terminal node value should be average of outcomes instead of max appearance
* Make sure to call new split criteria and terminal node function when making splits
* When building tree, be sure to call correct splitting function
* Bagging predict should predict average prediction across trees (or should this be max)
* When creating random forest, be sure to make the correct trees
