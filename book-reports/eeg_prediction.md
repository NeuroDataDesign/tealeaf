# Automatic epileptic seizure prediction based on scalp EEG and ECG signals
Paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7743357

## Methodology
The paper isn't interesting for our purposes. They take a 15 minute window before each seizure, compute a vector features from the time series using a wavelet transform, and then classify. Pretty mundane.
